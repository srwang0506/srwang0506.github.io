  about: [
    `Welcome to my homepage! I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student majoring in <strong>Computer Science and Technology</strong> at Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU). I'm a diligent and self-motivated learner, driven by curiosity and a desire to solve meaningful problems through my own efforts.`,

    `My research interests include <strong>Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction, Autonomous Driving, and Deepfake Detection</strong>. I hope to contribute to the AI community by creating something valuable and impactful. I'm currently preparing for graduate studies in 2027, aiming to explore these exciting fields in greater depth.`,

    `My favorite singer is <strong>Joker Xue</strong>. His music often brings me inspiration and emotional resonance. One lyric that particularly speaks to me is: <em>"All I have left in my pocket is a single rose, and the road ahead is long and mountainous."</em> It reminds me to stay gentle, resilient, and purposeful, no matter how far or challenging the journey becomes.`,
